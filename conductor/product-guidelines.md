# Product Guidelines

## Design Philosophy

**Developer Experience Priority** - Every feature should make the plugin pleasant and intuitive to use. Minimize friction, provide helpful feedback, and maintain consistency across commands.

## User Experience Principles

1. **Progressive disclosure** - Start simple, reveal complexity only when needed
2. **Sensible defaults** - Work out of the box with minimal configuration
3. **Clear feedback** - Always tell users what's happening and what to do next
4. **Recoverable** - Make it easy to undo mistakes (rollback support)
5. **Consistent** - Same patterns across all commands

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- All markdown files must be well-structured and readable
- JSON files must be valid and properly formatted
- Templates must have clear placeholder syntax ({{VARIABLE}})
- Commands must handle error cases gracefully

### Testing Requirements
- Integration testing by using the plugin on real projects
- Test each command's happy path and error cases
- Verify state persistence works across sessions
- Ensure git operations are safe (no data loss)

### Documentation Requirements
- Every command needs usage examples
- Agents need clear input/output specifications
- Templates need placeholder documentation
- README must stay current with features

## Accessibility Standards

- Use clear, jargon-free language in prompts
- Provide lettered choices for all interactive questions
- Support keyboard-only interaction
- Work in standard terminal environments

## Performance Guidelines

- Commands should respond quickly (< 2 seconds for simple operations)
- Avoid reading entire codebase when targeted analysis suffices
- Use incremental updates to metadata rather than full rewrites

## Security Requirements

- Never store secrets in conductor files
- Don't expose sensitive paths in generated content
- Validate all user input before processing
- Use safe git operations (revert, not reset --hard)

## Review Checklist

Before marking any task complete:

- [ ] Markdown renders correctly
- [ ] JSON is valid
- [ ] Error cases are handled
- [ ] User feedback is clear
- [ ] Documentation is updated
