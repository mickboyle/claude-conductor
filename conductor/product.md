# Claude Conductor

## Vision

A Claude Code plugin that transforms ephemeral AI sessions into structured, context-driven development with persistent Markdown artifacts.

## Problem Statement

AI coding sessions are ephemeral - context is lost between conversations, decisions aren't recorded, and complex features are difficult to track. Developers need a way to maintain structure and continuity when working with AI assistants on non-trivial features.

## Target Users

- Developers using Claude Code for feature development
- Teams wanting structured AI-assisted workflows
- Projects requiring documentation of AI-driven decisions

## Core Value Proposition

Replace ad-hoc AI sessions with a structured approach that:
- Captures requirements in specifications before coding
- Breaks complex work into phased, trackable tasks
- Maintains context across sessions
- Provides git-integrated progress tracking

## Key Features

1. **Interactive Setup** - Wizard-based project configuration with brownfield detection
2. **Track Management** - Feature-scoped development with specs and plans
3. **Phased Execution** - Tasks with subtasks and checkpoint validation
4. **Progress Tracking** - Visual status and git-integrated commits
5. **Review Validation** - Automated checks against project guidelines
6. **Rollback Support** - Git-based revert by task, phase, or track

## Success Metrics

- Reduced context loss between sessions
- Higher quality specifications before implementation
- Better tracking of feature progress
- Cleaner git history with atomic commits

## Constraints & Boundaries

- Plugin operates within Claude Code's capabilities
- Relies on Markdown for all artifacts (no database)
- Requires git for rollback functionality
- Does not replace CI/CD or external testing tools
