# Development Workflow

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Stable, released versions
- `track/<track-id>` - Feature development branches

Each track gets its own branch. Merge to main after review.

### Commit Standards

- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- First line is summary (50 chars max)
- Reference track ID in commits: `[TRACK-ID] Description`
- Atomic commits: one logical change per commit

### Commit Message Template

```
[TRACK-ID] Short description

Optional longer explanation if needed.
- Bullet points for details
- Reference related issues

## Test-Driven Development

**Approach:** Integration testing

For this plugin project:
1. Create a test project
2. Run `/conductor:setup` and verify output
3. Create a track with `/conductor:newTrack`
4. Execute tasks with `/conductor:implement`
5. Verify state files are correct
6. Test rollback with `/conductor:revert`

## Code Review Process

1. Complete all tasks in track
2. Run `/conductor:review` for automated checks
3. Manual review of generated files
4. Merge to main if passing

## Quality Gates

### Before Starting a Task
- [ ] Understand the requirement fully
- [ ] Identify affected files
- [ ] Review related existing content

### Before Marking Task Complete
- [ ] Markdown renders correctly
- [ ] JSON is valid (if applicable)
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed

### Before Completing a Phase
- [ ] All tasks in phase complete
- [ ] Manual testing performed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Ready for checkpoint review

## Continuous Integration

**Current:** Manual testing

**Future consideration:** Automated markdown linting and JSON validation.
