### Branch Strategy

### Commit Standards

- First line is summary (50 chars max)
- Reference track ID in commits: `[TRACK-ID] Description`
- Atomic commits: one logical change per commit

### Commit Message Template

```
[{{TRACK_ID}}] Short description

Optional longer explanation if needed.
- Bullet points for details
- Reference related issues
